# Negotiating<br>your Salary

<small>By Ray Villalobos</small>

---

## What is this about

- Job Application process
- Negotiating skills
- Help you be ready

> > Author Notes:

- This talk is more than just about making more money, I'm hoping to help you be comfortable with the salary negotiation process, specially for developers and show you the opportunities for when and how much money you should be asking for.

- Negotiating doesn't come natural, it's something you can learn over time. Not everyone is into it including some of the people hiring you.

- Learning how the process works and what to do should help put you at ease.

- It's part of the application process, so learning to ask some of these questions are going to help set the stage for your time at the company you're applying for.

## Why am I doing this?

> > Author Notes:

- The reason I taught myself about negotiation is that I had a really bad experience...I applied for a job at a local print shop and I trusted the owner to make me a reasonable offer. But when it was time to negotiate, he just looked at me and said. Why should I pay you more than what you're making now? That question really angered me because it forced me to start at a disadvantage and I felt it was insulting and demeaning.

- So, after getting him to improve his offer of paying me exactly what I was making, I decided that would never happen to me again. That I would learn the process of negotiating. Before my next job, I went to the library and researched negotiation and the hiring process. As I gained more time in the workforce, I learned about how big and small companies worked and when I became a manager I learned more about the hiring process and how to be comfortable navigating negotiation, which comes in handy in other places.

## Why should you do this?

- You're interviewing them
- You will negotiate
- You're interviewing them

> > Author Notes:

- One of the things that people miss about an intervie is that it's a two way process. You should be interviewing the company that you're applying for at the same time they're interviewing you. How they will treat you regarding compensation is established by your ability to negotiate.

- Wether you think you're doing this or not, negotiation is taking place. Choosing not to negotiate is a negotiation.

- When you're negotiating, you're letting them know that you're a professional who expects to be treated fairly, who is ready to negotiate contracts and other deals once you join the company. You are watching how they respond to a realistic and typical work task.

# Assesing your worth

---

## Before you look for a job

- How much you're worth
- What does the job pay?
- Minimum you're willing to take

> > Author Notes:

- Before you apply for a job, you need to make a realistic assessment of what you're worth and how much you should ask for. In order to negotiate properly, you need to know three things. First is how much money you're worth. We'll come back to this in a bit.

- Second is how much the job pays. This may or may not be posted on the job. You can also ask someone if you know someone working at the company...Don't be shy about this. Ask someone for a range if they're not comfortable sharing that. Another option is to look at online tools like the LinkedIn Salary stack overflow survey and others.

- The minimum you're willing to take is the amount that you'd be willing to walk away from a job opportunity if it doesn't meet your needs. Clearly you don't want to make less than what you're making now and I'd suggest at least a 10% increase in salary or more. Whatever it is, have a number ready.

## Resources

- [LinkedIn Salary](https://www.linkedin.com/salary?trk=jobshome_linkedin_salary)
- [Stack Overflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/)

## Salary depreciation

- 2-5% increases
- Rate of inflation
- Buying time.

> > Author Notes:

- When you're hired by a company and you negotiate a salary, that salary will grow on average 2-5% or more per year, but when you go to work for a different company, you can negotiate a much higher salary. You should look to make about 15% or more.

- In a way, think of a salary negotiation as buying time. It could take you 5 or more years for you to get a 15% increase in salary at your current company, but if you switch jobs, you could be making that same salary a lot quicker.

## Know your value

- Knowledge
- Experience
- Who you know

> > Author Notes:

- One of the things that separates development jobs from others is that your knowledge of certain topics has a big part of determining what you're worth. Unlike other industries, you have to continuously update your skills and you also have to demonstrate what you know during the interview process.

- In terms of experience, how long you've been programming is important, but also which programming languages you're familiar with makes an impact as well. Go, Clojure, and F#, are being paid more even given how much experience they have. It's simple supply and demand.

- Networking matters. The most common way developers found their most recent job was through a friend, family member, or former colleague who told them about it. The second most common, however, is by being contacted by someone at the company, such as a company recruiter. You need to use things like LinkedIn and Github to post both your resume, list your skills and also publish and work on projects.

# Before you negotiate

## Preparing

- LinkedIn Profile/Skills
- Code portfolio
- Network

> > Author Notes:

- Some things you should be doing continously, but specially as you start looking for new work is to update your LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn has a skills section that where you list the skills that you currently have. Companies who hire use this information to filter applicants, so you can take a look at the skills listed for jobs you want and make sure those are added to your resume if you want them.

- More importantly for a developer you should have a code portfolio. This means posting code on Github, contributing to open source, etc.

- As I mentioned before most people get their job from a reference, so it's important to network. That means participating in meetups and perhaps doing some speaking. I can tell you that this has never been easy for me since I'm an introvert, but networking has made a huge difference in my career. When you network, opportunities will come to you instead of having to search for them.

## Continuous deployment

- [Blog](https://raybo.org/)
- [Open source](https://github.com/planetoftheweb)
- [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)

> > Author Notes:

- Establish a small blog and post things. A lot of very popular blogs started from people wanting to write down something they wanted to remember later, so it's not as tough as you think. Turn those little notes into articles and help other people. Writing for others helps you organize your thoughts in a way that helps you learn something better.

- Contribute to open source. Some companies like Google recruit from Github instead of LinkedIn. That's because they can look at the code you write and see if it's a good fit. You can get started by turning something you've already done into a github repo. Build a template for a framework.

- Answer questions on Stack Overflow. Companies also hire from Stack Overflow because it proves that you're a quality individual who is helpful and understands complex topics and can communicate well.

- Codepen is another playground for designers. They give you the ability to write articles and post code samples, so it's a great place to store those snippets that are not only useful to you, but can prove to a potential employer that you have what it takes to work well.

# The Job App

---

## Know the process

1. HR Evaluates Candidates
1. Phone interview
1. In person interviews
1. Offer

> > Author Notes:

- Before you even think about type of negotiating, it's important to understand the landscape. Wether it's negotiating for a car or a job, if you show up unprepared, you won't be able to make the right deal.

---

## Transcending HR

- Job is posted
- Applicants filtered
- Call qualifiers
- Non negotiable

> > Author Notes:

- It's important to think about this from a company's perspective. The first step from their point of view is to find the right person from the job. In a bigger company, that means posting the job online and waiting for applications to arrive. This step is normally managed by an HR department. This department doesn't necessarily understand everything it takes to do the job, their job is to process applications and narrow them down to a manageable level.

- The hiring manager clearly doesn't want to schedule interviews with everyone who applies for a job, so at this point, It's important that your application/profile focuses on meeting the requirements of the job. Don't worry if you don't perfectly match all of the skills, but make sure you match most. At this point, your goal is to make it into the next step of the process.

- At this point, you need to prove that you meet the requirements listed on their application form. At this point, some bigger companies make the mistake of asking too much. Some companies don't seem to know the difference between [Java and Javascript](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1168448633/) (sigh).

- You should **never negotiate in this step**, but be aware that you might get some questions about how much you're looking to make at this stage.

My answer to these question is usually something like:

"I want to make sure this job is the right fit, so I'm not ready to negotiate my salary just yet. I'll be happy to talk about compensation you're ready to make me an offer."

If you're talking to HR person they won't be able to make you an offer. Sometimes they need to press you for an amount to make sure you're in the ballpark, so you can say something like.

"Salary is negotiable, what range does this position pay?"

HR is going to be more comfortable talking about a range. This range will probably be in the low end of what they're willing to pay you, but it will let both of you know you're in the ballpark. Practice your poker face."

## Secondary Interviews

- Proving you quality
- Get in-person interview
- Be nice
- Non negotiable

> > Author Notes:

- If you made it to this point, congrats. You've probably beaten out hundredths or thousands of applicants. It's time to prove that you have what it takes to do this job. You might get a preliminary phone call interview still with the HR person or might be talking to a hiring manager depending on the size of the company. You might have a technical interview at this point.

- Your main goal in the second interview is to get them to give you a in-person interview. If you've done some of the previous work like having a technical portoflio, you can show those things, don't assume they've seen them. This can be tough because we're generally taught to be humble, but stop it...this is the right time to toot your own horn.

- Wether you're interviewing with an HR person or the hiring manager, be polite, do some research about the company and the person (Look at their profile). The best thing you can do is stand out in a positive way from the others.

- This is also not a time to negotiate. You may still get some questions about salary at this point...once again this is to make sure that you don't have unrealistic expectations on what you're going to make. Handle them in the same way as before.

## The Live Interview

- You're the best
- Be nice
- Get to an offer

> > Author Notes:

- Congratulations, you've made it to the live interview. This is a great place to be. Your goal at this point is to prove to them that you're their best option. If you've bought something like a car, the employer is doing something like picking the car that they want. Which one has the best options, etc. You are trying to stand out.

- One thing people miss during this point in the interview is that managers hire people they want to work with. So it's real important to be nice and polite. To know something about the employer and ask good questions about the company. At this point you've proven that you can do the job, but it's time to prove you're their best option.

- It's almost time to negotiate. Your goal at this point is to get them committed to you and to make you an offer. You don't want to negotiate until they're ready to make you an offer. If you get any questions about salary here, I usually say something like this: "Salary is negotiable and I want to make sure we're both comfortable that this is the right fit for me and you. Are you ready to make me an offer?"

# Negotiating the offer

---

## The Offer

- They want you
- Get them to speak first
- Compensation not salary

> > Author Notes:

- Congratulations, you've arrived at the pinnacle of the job process. An offer means that they want to hire you! Not the other people they're interviewing, but you personally. You are their number one choice. At this point in their mind they've bought the car. They can picture you working there being productive and helpful to the company.

- I'm assuming that at this point in the conversation, they talked about salary and asked you how much do you want to make. If they say that they're ready to make you an offer, then simply ask them what their offer is.

- It's important to think of compensation as not just your salary but the entire package. What is the base salary, what about equity, stock options, how much would you be paying for insurance? How many vacation days do you get? What are other perks. All of these things have real value and are calculations that make comparing jobs difficult. Also, make sure you ask how often they give raises, etc. Your job is to gather information at this point, write down some notes. Once you receive that information, ask for it in writing.

---

## The Offer Letter

- Professionals
- Think it over
- Negotiate?

> > Author Notes:

- Real professionals ask for offer letters. Also, great companies write their offers down to make sure things are clear between the two parties. At this point you should ask for a couple of days to think it over. If you're really excited and you know the offer is good, then feel free to accept it, but it's sometimes better to extract yourself from the excitement and take the time to go through their numbers carefully. Sometimes their salary will be great, but you pay so much more for insurance that it won't be a good deal.

- Now it's time for you to make a decision about the company you interviewed with. I did mention that interviewing is a two way process. With an offer letter, the tables turn and you should examine everything you learned about the company and ask yourself if this is the best place for you to be. Do they have your interests in mind. Are they dedicated to helping you grow. How often do they review your compensation. What is the team you're working with like?

- You may be having second thoughts about leaving your current job. Maybe the company that you're working for is really great, but the fact that you're not getting to your earning potential is what is really bothering you. You can choose to negotiate with your current company at this point. If you have feelings like this, make an appointment with your manager and tell them how you feel. They may be willing to make you a counter offer. They may be willing to give you a promotion. Staying where you are is fine and sometimes the best option. If you are working in a great place that cares about you and gives you opportunity for growth, that's sometimes worth as much as monetary compensation.

## Doing it...or not

- Accepting the offer
- Negotiating
- Turning it down

> > Author Notes:

- After you've talked it over with your family (it might involve some disruption like moving somewhere else or adjusting schedules) and took at deep look at the offer, it's time to accept it. Make sure you save that offer letter, and get ready to continue your career.

- If there are specific issues with compensation you can talk to them about them and negotiate what they're offering. Everything is on the table at this point. This is when it's important to keep those numbers you thought of before. There is an optimal amount you want to make and a 'walk away' amount you should have in your head. You can negotiate things other than salary. Are they willing to give you an extra week of vacation (since that's what you were getting at the other company). There are things that the company can adjust. For example, if your company pays a bigger percentage of the insurance, they can adjust your salary to compensate.

- If they are not willing or able to get to a reasonable agreement, then it's time to walk away. Observing how a company negotiates is a good way to gauge how they are going to treat you as a profesional. It's also a good way to demonstrate how you're going to act as an employee.

- It's ok to turn the offer down if it's not the right offer. This is tough for both of you since you've placed a lot into this. It's really important that you're willing to walk away. Be polite, just say something like this.

"I'm not sure this is the right offer for me, thank you for your time, I really hope you can find the right person to fill this position."

Sometimes they'll make you their best offer after this, sometimes they won't be able to. In your heart though when you walk away, make sure you're are not just doing it because you want more money, make sure you're doing it because it isn't a good deal.
